      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Early Life & Background</h3>
        <p>I was born on August 2, 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now Belarus). In 1934, my family moved to what was then British Mandate Palestine. From an early age, I was inspired by the dream of building a homeland for the Jewish people — a place of peace, progress, and purpose.</p>

        <h3>Political Leadership</h3>
        <p>I served my country for over six decades — as Prime Minister, President, Minister of Defense, and in many other roles. I helped shape Israel’s defense strategy, led peace talks, and championed innovation. I always believed that leadership meant serving the people with vision and responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Peace & Vision</h3>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          “Peace is the greatest weapon of mass construction.”<br>— Shimon Peres
        </blockquote>
        <p>Throughout my life, I believed that peace is not just a dream — it is a mission. I was honored to receive the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords. Even in the face of conflict, I remained committed to dialogue and hope.</p>

        <h3>Innovation & the Future</h3>
        <p>I was passionate about science, education, and technology. I believed that Israel’s strength comes not just from its military, but from the creativity of its people. In my later years, I focused on advancing innovation and inspiring young minds to think big.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Passions</h3>
        <p>In my private moments, I loved to read poetry and philosophy. I was deeply inspired by literature, especially the works of great poets like Yehuda Amichai. Music also touched my soul — I found it to be a universal language that transcends borders. Walking in nature gave me peace and time to reflect. I also had a deep admiration for art and creativity in all forms.</p>

        <h3>People Who Inspired Me</h3>
        <p>David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding Prime Minister, was one of my greatest mentors. His vision and courage shaped the nation — and my life. I was also inspired by global leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, who showed that change is possible through strength of character and commitment to justice. From scientists to poets, from pioneers to peacemakers — I always admired those who dared to dream.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          “Optimists and pessimists die the exact same death, but they live very different lives.”
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>I am proud to have played a role in the story of Israel. My dream was always that the next generation would live not by the sword, but by the book, the plow, and the chip. I believe that tomorrow can be better than today — and that it’s up to us to make it so.</p>

      <h2>Q&A</h2>
      <article class="qa-item">
        <h3>1. Three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Web1 was the first version of the internet. Websites were basic and only gave information. You could read stuff, but you couldn’t comment, post, or interact — just read-only pages.</li>
          <li>Web2 is the internet we mostly use today. It lets people share content, post on social media, comment, and interact. Apps like Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram are Web2. But big companies control the platforms and our data.</li>
          <li>Web3 is a newer idea. It’s based on blockchain and wants to give control back to users. It’s more private, secure, and personalized. People can own their data and use apps without a central company in charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Use case: searching for “side effects of medication”</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In Web1, I would see a basic article or list on a website. No comments, no opinions — just plain text written by the site owner.</li>
          <li>In Web2, I’d find blog posts, videos, and forum discussions. I could read reviews from real people, leave a comment, or ask questions. But the info is stored and tracked by companies like Google or Facebook.</li>
          <li>In Web3, I could use a health app that respects my privacy and gives results based on my personal health data (if I choose to share it). The app could be built on blockchain and use AI to give me the most relevant info, without anyone owning or selling my data.</li>
        </ul>
