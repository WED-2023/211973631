      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Early Life & Background</h3>
        <p>I was born on August 2, 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now Belarus). In 1934, my family moved to what was then British Mandate Palestine. From an early age, I was inspired by the dream of building a homeland for the Jewish people ‚Äî a place of peace, progress, and purpose.</p>

        <h3>Political Leadership</h3>
        <p>I served my country for over six decades ‚Äî as Prime Minister, President, Minister of Defense, and in many other roles. I helped shape Israel‚Äôs defense strategy, led peace talks, and championed innovation. I always believed that leadership meant serving the people with vision and responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Peace & Vision</h3>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          ‚ÄúPeace is the greatest weapon of mass construction.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Shimon Peres
        </blockquote>
        <p>Throughout my life, I believed that peace is not just a dream ‚Äî it is a mission. I was honored to receive the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords. Even in the face of conflict, I remained committed to dialogue and hope.</p>

        <h3>Innovation & the Future</h3>
        <p>I was passionate about science, education, and technology. I believed that Israel‚Äôs strength comes not just from its military, but from the creativity of its people. In my later years, I focused on advancing innovation and inspiring young minds to think big.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Passions</h3>
        <p>In my private moments, I loved to read poetry and philosophy. I was deeply inspired by literature, especially the works of great poets like Yehuda Amichai. Music also touched my soul ‚Äî I found it to be a universal language that transcends borders. Walking in nature gave me peace and time to reflect. I also had a deep admiration for art and creativity in all forms.</p>

        <h3>People Who Inspired Me</h3>
        <p>David Ben-Gurion, Israel‚Äôs founding Prime Minister, was one of my greatest mentors. His vision and courage shaped the nation ‚Äî and my life. I was also inspired by global leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, who showed that change is possible through strength of character and commitment to justice. From scientists to poets, from pioneers to peacemakers ‚Äî I always admired those who dared to dream.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          ‚ÄúOptimists and pessimists die the exact same death, but they live very different lives.‚Äù
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>I am proud to have played a role in the story of Israel. My dream was always that the next generation would live not by the sword, but by the book, the plow, and the chip. I believe that tomorrow can be better than today ‚Äî and that it‚Äôs up to us to make it so.</p>

  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  <article class="qa-item">
    <h3>1. Three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>üîπ Web1 (Web 1.0) ‚Äî The Static Web:</strong><br>
        Web1 was the earliest form of the internet, active mainly from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. It consisted of static web pages built using basic HTML and served primarily as a digital library or information directory. There was no interaction between users and websites beyond reading the content. Users were consumers, not contributors. Websites were created and controlled by individuals or institutions, and the content remained fixed unless manually updated by the website owner. There were no social media platforms, comment sections, or dynamic features.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        <strong>üî∏ Web2 (Web 2.0) ‚Äî The Social Web:</strong><br>
        Web2 revolutionized how we interact online. Starting around the mid-2000s, it introduced interactivity, participation, and user-generated content. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and platforms like YouTube enabled people to create, share, and comment. Blogs, forums, wikis, and collaborative tools became widespread. The user was no longer just a viewer ‚Äî now they were a content creator. However, this shift came with a trade-off: the rise of large tech companies that controlled user data, created closed ecosystems, and monetized personal information through targeted advertising.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        <strong>üî∑ Web3 (Web 3.0) ‚Äî The Decentralized Web:</strong><br>
        Web3 is the current and future direction of the internet, built around decentralization, privacy, and trust. Powered by blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks, Web3 allows users to own their digital identities and data. Platforms run without central authorities using smart contracts, and users can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps). AI and machine learning also play a bigger role in creating personalized and semantic (meaning-based) web experiences. Instead of trusting platforms, users rely on transparent code and cryptographic validation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Use case: Searching for ‚Äúside effects of medication‚Äù</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>üåê Web1 Experience:</strong><br>
        In Web1, a user searching for ‚Äúside effects of medication‚Äù would find basic, text-heavy web pages ‚Äî likely medical databases or institutional sites. These pages would be static, offering generic lists without interaction. No user reviews, no community input, no ability to ask follow-up questions. The information may be reliable but outdated, and there was no way to verify credibility or ask for clarification.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        <strong>üåç Web2 Experience:</strong><br>
        On Web2, the same search would bring up diverse content: YouTube videos explaining the medication, Reddit threads where users share their experiences, blog posts, online pharmacies, and reviews. You could comment on a video, ask others about their side effects, and even connect with people with similar health concerns. However, your search history would be tracked by platforms like Google or Facebook, stored in centralized servers, and potentially sold or used to target pharmaceutical ads to you across the web.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        <strong>üõ°Ô∏è Web3 Experience:</strong><br>
        In Web3, you'd use a privacy-respecting, decentralized health application. After giving consent, the app could securely analyze your health records (stored on a blockchain or local wallet) and return side effects specifically relevant to your age, gender, and medical history. The data would not be sold or stored in a central server. You might even receive feedback from a trusted peer-reviewed network or AI-powered personal assistant. The system would be transparent, and you‚Äôd have complete control over what data you share and with whom.
